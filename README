The goal of the test is to test how mysql execute INSERT and SELECT for tables with and witout indexes.

SELECT, Rows Count = 40k;
No Index
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth = @v_date	3 row(s) returned	0.016 sec / 0.000 sec
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth > @v_date	25247 row(s) returned	0.000 sec / 0.046 sec
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth < @v_date	14751 row(s) returned	0.000 sec / 0.031 sec

BTree Index
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth = @v_date	3 row(s) returned	0.000 sec / 0.000 sec
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth > @v_date	25247 row(s) returned	0.015 sec / 0.047 sec
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth < @v_date	14751 row(s) returned	0.000 sec / 0.032 sec

Hash Index
SELECT * FROM Users_Hash WHERE DateOfBirth = @v_date	6 row(s) returned	0.000 sec / 0.000 sec
SELECT * FROM Users_Hash WHERE DateOfBirth > @v_date	25123 row(s) returned	0.000 sec / 0.031 sec
SELECT * FROM Users_Hash WHERE DateOfBirth < @v_date	14871 row(s) returned	0.015 sec / 0.031 sec


SELECT, Rows Count = 40M;
No Index
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth = '2011-04-27'	4017 row(s) returned	    1.453 sec
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth > '2011-04-27'	16882925 row(s) returned	0.000 sec
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth < '2011-04-27'	24153058 row(s) returned	0.000 sec


BTree Index
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth = '2011-04-27'	4017 row(s) returned	    0.032 sec
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth > '2011-04-27'	16882925 row(s) returned	0.000 sec
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE DateOfBirth < '2011-04-27'	24153058 row(s) returned	0.016 sec

HASH Index
Didn't work for me, as I had warning like  "The storage engine (InnoDB) does not support the HASH INDEX".
The option I have found is to re-create table with the explicit set Engine as MEMORY, but it doesn't allow to fit so many records in the memory.
